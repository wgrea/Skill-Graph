# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```sh
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.


## 🧠 **UX / DX / Skill Development**
Skill Graph just started and will look at how I want to improve it
Make the adjacencies show in lines. 
Should see what is in high demand
Want to show the other types of experience like dx, cx, etc. 
Got to eventually split the file to be more understanding, but after improving the graph.
I can add prerequisites
Should maybe check out LinkedIn Skills Graph and see what it does that I should do and also see what I think it should do.
Later: Lack of "why" behind connections - Your tool could explain why Data Scientist and Product Manager roles are adjacent.
Later: Missing "skill translation" - How skills in one role transfer to another.
I also want users to be able to find their niche
Study UX fundamentals
Which are exclusive to UX and which overlap with DX and CX?
Study Developer Experience fundamentals
Study Customer Experience fundamentals
Add fundamentals to documentation as to‑dos
Niche skill-building app
Beginner versions of deep-expertise roles
Skill adjacency map (Mermaid.js)
List which skills can be on the same chart
Add graphic design to adjacency page
Identify portable + high‑order skills
Clarify UX vs DX overlap
Where to store fundamental info you learn
Test skill app idea in Figma Make
Overlaps between user feedback, user research, and user research that requires a masters
What of ux requires a masters?
